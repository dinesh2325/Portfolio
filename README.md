## üìß Contact Form & Email Implementation

### Current Setup
The contact form currently **simulates** message sending for demonstration purposes. Messages are logged to the console but not actually sent via email.

### Email Implementation Options

To receive real messages from your portfolio visitors, you can implement one of these solutions:

#### 1. **EmailJS (Recommended for Static Sites)**
```javascript
// Add EmailJS to your project
// https://www.emailjs.com/

emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', {
    from_name: name,
    from_email: email,
    subject: subject,
    message: message
});
```

#### 2. **Formspree (Simple Form Handling)**
```html
<!-- Update your form action -->
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

#### 3. **Netlify Forms (If hosted on Netlify)**
```html
<!-- Add netlify attribute to form -->
<form name="contact" netlify>
```

#### 4. **Custom Backend Solution**
- Node.js with Nodemailer
- Python with Flask/Django + SMTP
- PHP mail() function
- Serverless functions (Vercel, Netlify Functions)

### Implementation Steps
1. Choose an email service provider
2. Update the `sendContactMessage()` function in `script.js`
3. Replace the simulation with actual email sending logic
4. Test thoroughly with real email addresses
